                <h2 class="mt-5">1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
                <p>
                    These Terms and Conditions constitute a legally binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity (“you”) and Prime Cleaning NC (“Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”), concerning your access to and use of the [Seu Dominio.com] website.

                <h4>Service Scope</h4>
                <p>
                    We provide residential, commercial, and home improvement cleaning services in North Carolina, USA. The scope of the service is defined in the final quote provided to the customer. Any services requested outside the agreed-upon quote may incur additional charges.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Pricing and Payment</h4>
                <p>
                    Prices for our services are subject to change without notice. We reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue the Service without notice at any time. Payment is due upon completion of the service unless other arrangements have been agreed upon in writing. We accept [Listar Formas de Pagamento].

                <h2 class="mt-5">3. Cancellation and Rescheduling Policy</h2>
                <p>
                    Clients must provide at least **48 hours notice** for any service cancellation or rescheduling. Failure to provide adequate notice will result in a cancellation fee, typically [Definir Taxa, ex: $50] or 50% of the service price. This fee is to cover the loss of scheduled time for our team.
                </p>

                <h4>Damage Policy</h4>
                <p>
                    While we are fully insured, any damage must be reported within 24 hours of service completion. We are not responsible for damage to items that are not secured or that are already showing signs of wear and tear, or improper installation.
