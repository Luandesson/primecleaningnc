                <h2 class="mt-5">1. Our 100% Satisfaction Guarantee</h2>
                <p>
                    At Prime Cleaning NC, we stand by the quality of our service. If you are not completely satisfied with a cleaning service for any reason, please contact us within **24 hours** of the service completion date. We do not offer direct monetary refunds as a first measure. Instead, we offer a **re-clean guarantee**.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will return to your property within **2 business days** to re-clean any area(s) you are unsatisfied with, at no extra cost to you.
                </p>

                <h2 class="mt-5">2. Eligibility for Re-Clean or Refund</h2>
                <p>
                    To be eligible for a complimentary re-clean, you must notify us within the **24-hour window** via email or phone, providing specific details and photos (if possible) of the areas of concern.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Conditions Where Re-Clean May Not Apply:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the customer or another party cleans or attempts to fix the areas before we return.</li>
                    <li>For issues unrelated to the quality of our cleaning (e.g., normal wear and tear, pre-existing damage, or items not covered in the original quote).</li>
                    <li>If the client was present during the cleaning and did not point out the issue before the team left the premises.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="mt-5">3. Monetary Refunds</h2>
                <p>
                    Monetary refunds are granted only in the event that a re-clean is not possible, or if the re-clean service still fails to meet reasonable quality standards (determined by Prime Cleaning NC management).
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a monetary refund is approved, it will be processed and credited back to your original method of payment within **7-10 business days**. The refund amount may be prorated based on the specific areas of concern.
                </p>

                <h2 class="mt-5">4. Cancellation Policy</h2>
                <p>
                    We require a minimum of **48 hours notice** for service cancellations or rescheduling. Cancellations made with less than 48 hours notice may result in a cancellation fee of $50 or 50% of the service cost.
                </p>

                <h2 class="mt-5">5. Contact Us</h2>
